## Summary:
This group project has pretty much the same procedure as the regression project, so I will just create a summary here, more details can be found in the notebook attached. 
### 1. Conclusions:
This is a classification problem and the best model to predict if a person has metabolic syndrome or not is Decision Tree. The most important variables in predicting the syndrome include WaistCirc, HDL, Age, BloodGlucose, Triglycerides and Income. More details about the analysis can be found in the jupyter notebook attached.
### 2. Challengages:
- The data is not clean yet with missing values and outliers
- Most numeric variables are skewed or not normally distributed
### 3. Cool techniques:
In this analysis, we use different methods to:
- Cleaning and prepare data:
  - Treating missing values by removing them from the dataset
  - Correcting skewness using log10 transformation
- Data analytics:
    - Using statistical analysis for descriptive analysis to see outliers presense and correlation among variables
    - Machine learning techniques: KNN, logistic regression, support vector classifier (SVC), decision tree.
- Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Feature Engineering: Lasso regression and Chi-square to choose the most significant variables to the difference in target variable
### 4. Where to get the data:
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antimoni/metabolic-syndrome/data
This dataset contains information on individuals with metabolic syndrome, a complex medical condition associated with a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The data includes demographic, clinical, and laboratory measurements, as well as the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome.
